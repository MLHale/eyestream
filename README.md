# Eyestream: Gazepoint Websockets
This project converts eye tracker data collected from a Gazepoint GP3 to simple JSON and then sends collected events to an experimentation platform, such as the Cybertrust phishing research platform, using websockets.

## Hardware Requirements
* Gazepoint GP3 HD (https://www.gazept.com/product-category/gp3-hd/)
* Gazepoint Control v3.5.0 +

> Please note that due to the GP3 drivers and hardware APIs only supporting Windows, Eyestream only works on Windows. Eyestream was tested on Windows 10 enterprise edition (July 2018), but should work on any version of Windows 8 or above.

## Software Requirements
* Python 2, >= 2.7.9 See: https://www.python.org/downloads
* python pip (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
<!-- * ntplib for time Synchronization (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ntplib/) -->
* PyOpenGaze (https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyOpenGaze)
* Django channels (https://github.com/django/channels)
* Docker (https://www.docker.com)

> Please note that Eyestream is written for Python 2 and has not tested for Python 3.

## Installation
### Hardware
Follow the GP3 setup guide, connecting the data USB port to a USB3 port.
Install the Gazepoint remote and control server using the Gasepoint Installer located here (https://www.gazept.com/downloads/), using valid access credentials provided with purchase of the GP3.

### Software
First install python, pip. and docker. Then:

```
pip install pypiwin32
pip install channels
pip install asgi_redis
git clone https://github.com/MLHale/eyestream
docker pull redis
```

## Getting Started
```bash 
cd <path-to-eyestream>/scripts
start startserver.bat
```

## Starting a client-side websocket
The Gazepoint websocket server can be invoked using a client-side web socket invoked as follows:

```js
socket = new WebSocket("ws://" + window.location.host + "/gazepoint/");
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log(event.data);//log received messages
    //implement your client-side hooks here on event
}
socket.onopen = function() {
    //send username to server so it can append it to the generated tracker events
    socket.send(JSON.stringify({
  	username: 'testname'
    }));
}
// Call onopen directly if socket is already open
if (socket.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) socket.onopen();
```

This will start the websocket server process to:
* Start the gazepoint controller in its own thread.
* Initiate the eye tracker logging mechanisms and infinitely loop to capture eye events
* wait for the socket to close, at which point the loop terminates, the logger shuts down, and the gazepoint controller is killed.

## License
Eyestream: Converts and serializes eye tracker data collected from a Gazepoint GP3 into a simple JSON format before streaming it to an application of choice at frequencies of up to 150hz. Eyestreams works for a variety of real-time eye tracker needs such as eye-driven UI, experimentation platforms, or medical apps.
